# Task 3: Smart Chatbot for Customer Support

## Project Overview
This project involves building a functional AI-powered chatbot designed to handle real-time customer support queries. The bot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user intent and provides automated responses for common FAQs.

## Features
- **Intent Recognition:** Uses NLTK's Regular Expression (Regex) matching to identify user needs (Greetings, Tracking, Refunds, etc.).
- **FAQ Support Flows:** Pre-defined conversation paths for common customer issues.
- **Smart Fallback Handling:** A "catch-all" logic that gracefully handles unrecognized inputs to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Web Deployment:** A live interactive interface powered by Gradio.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Deployment:** Gradio
- **Platform:** Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the `FUTURE_ML_03.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run the first cell to install `nltk` and `gradio`.
3. Execute the logic and deployment cells.
4. Click the public URL generated by Gradio to interact with the bot in your browser.

## Dataset
The conversation patterns were derived and inspired by the **Customer Support Conversations** dataset from Kaggle.
